# BLUEPRINT Business Strategy

## Current Focus
**Phase 0: Bootstrap**
- Define and build tripwire product (entry point for BLUEPRINT business)
- Validate market demand
- Acquire first consulting clients
- Dog-food BLUEPRINT platform on own business

## Immediate Priorities

### Priority 0: Build and Launch Tripwire (ACTIVE)
**Product:** "Software Factory Foundations" ($147)
**Framework:** 6 practices (Small batches, TDD, Feature flags, DDD, Product Engineering, CI/CD)
**Target ICP:** Both ICP #1 (leaders) and ICP #2 (engineers)

**Status:** ACTIVE - Building now with Software Factory vision integrated

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Finalize module structure (4 modules with immediate implementation value)
- [ ] Create templates and tools (test-driven prompts, feature flag code, implementation checklists)
- [ ] Write Module 1 content (diagnosis + first practice implementation)
- [ ] Build landing pages (A/B test messaging angles)
- [ ] Set up payment and delivery (Gumroad + hosting)
- [ ] Beta test with 5-10 early students
- [ ] Launch to network

### Priority 1: Corporate Training Revenue Stream (PAUSED)
**Course:** "Build Your Software Factory Prototype" (delivered as "Agentic Coding z AI" 2-day training)
**Target ICP:** ICP #2 (Aspirational Engineers - practitioners + ambassadors)
**Delivery:** Use training company's agenda, frame as Software Factory, weave in 6 practices

## Target Market: Dual ICP Strategy

We target two interconnected customer profiles that create a powerful revenue and growth flywheel:

### ICP #1: Engineering Leaders (Consulting Revenue)
**Who:** CTOs, VPs of Engineering, Engineering Directors
**Company:** Post-PMF B2B SaaS, $1-5M ARR, 5-15 engineers
**Revenue:** Consulting engagements ($5K-15K)
**Sales Cycle:** 1-3 months
**Strategic Value:** High-value transformations, case studies, long-term BLUEPRINT customers

**Key Characteristics:**
- Visionary, early adopter, tech-forward
- Frustrated by velocity plateau despite hiring
- AI adoption happening chaotically (need systematic approach)
- Want to build Software Factory foundation
- Budget authority for consulting engagements

### ICP #2: Aspirational Engineers (Training Revenue + Ambassadors)
**Who:** Senior developers, architects, tech leads, DevOps engineers
**Seniority:** 5+ years, want career advancement to architecture/leadership
**Revenue:** Corporate training deliveries (~$1.5K per delivery, 15-20 participants)
**Sales Cycle:** Immediate (quarterly training schedule)
**Strategic Value:** Direct cashflow, internal champions, consulting leads, ambassadors

**Key Characteristics:**
- Career-focused, lifelong learners, community-oriented
- Want to transition from "coder" to "factory engineer/architect"
- Excited about AI but want systematic approach (not ad-hoc)
- Fear obsolescence, want skills AI can't replace (design, supervision)
- Can evangelize Software Factory to leadership at their company

### The Dual ICP Flywheel

**How they work together:**
1. Corporate training → ICP #2 (aspirational engineers) learn Software Factory
2. Engineers become internal champions → Evangelize to ICP #1 (CTOs/VPs)
3. ICP #1 books consultation → Consulting engagement ($5K-15K)
4. Success creates case studies → More ICP #2 want training
5. ICP #2 become external ambassadors → Blog posts, talks, LinkedIn
6. More awareness → More training + More consulting → REPEAT

**Key Insight:** ICP #2 generates both direct revenue (training) AND consulting leads (ICP #1 through bottom-up evangelism)

## Strategic Decisions Made

### ✅ Decision 1: Tripwire Product
**Chosen:** "Engineering Excellence for Product Velocity"
- 6 practices framework (execution + strategic)
- Product Engineering as key differentiator
- AI as component, not focus
- Two messaging angles for A/B testing

### ✅ Decision 2: Pricing
**Tripwire:** $147 (premium positioning, filters serious buyers)
**Consulting:** $5K-15K (depends on team size, scope)
**BLUEPRINT:** TBD (after alpha testing)

### ✅ Decision 3: Value Ladder
1. Tripwire teaches foundation (3 practices)
2. Consulting implements full stack (6 practices + BLUEPRINT)
3. BLUEPRINT platform enables ongoing management

### ✅ Decision 4: Corporate Training Revenue Stream
**Course:** "Agentic Coding z AI - Claude Code i Cline w praktyce" (2-day training, delivered as trainer)
**Role:** Trainer delivering their curriculum with 6 practices framework woven in

**Strategic Rationale:**
This training opportunity creates a revenue engine that funds and accelerates all strategic priorities:

**1. Revenue Engine for Core Vision**
- **Income:** ~$1.5K per 2-day delivery (trainer fee from training company)
- **Repeatable:** Quarterly deliveries = $6K-18K/year potential (4-12 deliveries)
- **Economics:** Covers living expenses during bootstrap, provides runway
- **True Value:** Lead generation (consulting clients worth $5K-15K each) far exceeds direct training revenue

**2. Lead Generation for Consulting (Priority 2)**
- **Warm Leads:** 15-20 participants per training are qualified prospects
- **Conversion:** 3-5 consultation bookings (15-25%), 1-2 consulting clients (5-10%)
- **Value:** Each consulting client = $5K-15K (one training can generate 1-2 clients)
- **Network Effects:** Participants refer others, build corporate relationships

**3. Authority & Brand Building**
- **Positioning:** Corporate trainer at established companies (credibility signal)
- **Differentiation:** Not just tools instructor, but practices expert who teaches tools systematically
- **LinkedIn Authority:** "Training at [Company X]", participant testimonials, social proof
- **Network:** 15-20 new connections per training, referrals, opportunities

**4. Content Marketing Fuel (Priority 4)**
- **Per Training:** 3-5 blog posts, 10-15 LinkedIn posts, testimonials, case studies
- **Topics:** "What 20 engineers learned about AI + practices", "Why Claude Code fails without TDD"
- **Authenticity:** Real-world examples from actual corporate teams
- **SEO & Reach:** Corporate names, participant shares, increased visibility

**5. BLUEPRINT Validation (Priority 3)**
- **Research:** Learn what context AI agents need from real practitioners
- **Pain Points:** Discover gaps in current tooling and workflows
- **Validation:** Test thesis that structured business context is needed
- **Iteration:** Use insights to guide BLUEPRINT design and feature priorities

**6. Tripwire Enhancement (Priority 1)**
- **Proven Demand:** Corporate training validates market need for systematic AI adoption
- **Content Reuse:** Training materials can be adapted for tripwire course
- **Testimonials:** Use training testimonials for tripwire marketing
- **Angle B Validation:** "You don't know how to adopt AI for velocity" proven with real customers

**Key Insight:**
The training company positions AI tools as the hero. We deliver their curriculum but weave in engineering practices throughout (small batches during refactoring examples, TDD during code review, etc.). Participants come for tools, leave understanding they need practices. Perfect trojan horse for consulting lead generation.

**Delivery Strategy:**
- Use their agenda (don't rework until proven)
- Weave 6 practices into examples and explanations naturally
- End-of-Day-2 CTA: "Want to implement systematic practices across your team?"
- Capture emails, LinkedIn connections, book consultations

**Economics:**
- **Investment:** 2 days delivery + 3-5 days prep (first time), 1 day prep (subsequent)
- **Direct Revenue:** ~$1.5K per training
- **Indirect Value:** 1-2 consulting clients ($5K-15K each) + content + authority + network
- **Total Value per Training:** ~$6.5K-16.5K (direct + consulting conversions)
- **Frequency:** Monthly/quarterly deliveries possible

**Timing:** Phase 0 (bootstrap) - perfect revenue engine to fund all other priorities

## Open Strategic Questions

1. **Which messaging angle leads? (A/B test)**
   - Angle A: Velocity ceiling (hired engineers, still slow)
   - Angle B: AI adoption (adopted AI, need practices)
   - Plan: Test both, optimize for conversion

2. **How much to invest in BLUEPRINT before revenue?**
   - Currently: Dog-fooding on own business
   - Next: Alpha with first 2-3 consulting clients (part of engagement)
   - When to polish: After beta validation (20+ teams using it)

3. **Resource allocation (next 3 months)?**
   - 50% Tripwire (build, launch, market) - primary focus
   - 20% Consulting (acquire clients from tripwire, deliver)
   - 15% BLUEPRINT (dog-food, alpha) - funded by tripwire revenue
   - 15% Content/Marketing (primarily from tripwire insights and student stories)

4. **When to hire first person?**
   - After $50K revenue (or 6 months, whichever first)
   - Role: Developer (help build BLUEPRINT) OR consultant (deliver transformations)

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Tripwire doesn't convert
- **Mitigation:** A/B test both messaging angles, iterate based on feedback, have 3rd angle ready (generic velocity)

**Risk 2:** No consulting demand from tripwire
- **Mitigation:** Strong CTA in Module 4, email nurture sequence, free consultation offer, network outreach in parallel

**Risk 3:** Implementation too complex for students
- **Mitigation:** Beta test with 5-10 early students, simplify based on feedback, provide code examples by tech stack

**Risk 4:** AI hype fades (if leading with Angle B)
- **Mitigation:** Have Angle A ready (velocity focus), position as engineering excellence (not AI tips), pivot messaging as needed
