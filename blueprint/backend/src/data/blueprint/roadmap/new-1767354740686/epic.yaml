  Educational Content is very important in product acquisition funnel. We want
  Blueprint to support its development supported by AI (just like we do
  primarily for software development itself)

    name: Tripwire Product
    description: >-
      Course content authoring layer for Blueprint. Enables structured creation
      and management of educational content (like "Software Factory 2027"
      tripwire course) with hierarchical navigation: Course → Modules →
      Lectures/Prompts/Templates.

      The DSL uses YAML for metadata (course.yaml, module.yaml) and Markdown for
      content. Visualization supports drill-down navigation with AI-assisted
      editing.

      I imagine I can have multiple tripwire products, but the current
      implementation allows only for one
