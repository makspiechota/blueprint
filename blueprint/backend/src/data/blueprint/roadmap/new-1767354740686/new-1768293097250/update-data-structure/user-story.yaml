  As a content creator,
  I want to organize multiple courses in separate directories,
  So that each course has its own isolated content structure.

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Courses stored in tripwire/courses/{course-id}/ directories
  - Each course has its own course.yaml and modules/ folder
  - Migrate existing single course to new structure
  - Course ID derived from directory name
