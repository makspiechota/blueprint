# Tripwire Product: "Engineering Excellence for Claude Code"

## The Core Insight

Claude Code is incredibly powerful. But most engineers use it like a fancy autocomplete - asking it to "write a function that does X" and hoping for the best. They're using a manufacturing robot as a typewriter.

The engineers who get 10x results from Claude Code aren't better prompters. They're better engineers. They apply the same practices that made them effective before AI - and those practices make AI exponentially more effective.

**Three practices. That's all it takes.**

1. **Spec-Driven Development** - Write the test first, let Claude Code implement
2. **Small Batch Workflow** - Break work into 30-minute chunks Claude Code can execute reliably
3. **Context Management** - Give Claude Code the architectural knowledge it needs to make good decisions

These aren't AI tricks. They're engineering fundamentals that happen to unlock AI's full potential.

## Why Engineering Excellence + Claude Code

Most "AI productivity" content focuses on prompts, tips, and hacks. That's backwards.

Claude Code is modeled on human reasoning. It thinks like an engineer. Which means it needs the same things a good engineer needs:
- Clear specifications (not vague requirements)
- Manageable scope (not sprawling epics)
- Architectural context (not isolated file edits)

Engineers who already practice TDD, small batches, and domain modeling don't need to learn "AI skills." Their existing skills ARE the AI skills. Claude Code amplifies what they already do well.

Engineers who skip these practices? Claude Code amplifies their chaos.

**This product teaches the practices that make Claude Code work - practices that also make YOU a better engineer.**

## The Product: "Engineering Excellence for Claude Code"

**Tagline:** "The practices that make great engineers also make great AI supervisors."

**Format:** Video course + templates + code examples

**Price:** $47

**Length:** 3 hours of focused content + implementation exercises

### Module 1: Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code

**The principle:** Never ask Claude Code to implement something you can't verify. Write the test first. The test IS the specification.

**What you'll learn:**
- Why "write a function that does X" fails and "make this test pass" succeeds
- The Test-First Loop: Red → Claude Code → Green → Refactor
- Writing specs Claude Code can execute against (not just tests, but executable specifications)
- When to write the test yourself vs. asking Claude Code to write it
- The "Two Agents" pattern: one writes tests, one implements (adversarial validation)

**Practical exercises:**
- Convert a vague feature request into executable specs
- Implement a feature using Test-First Loop with Claude Code
- Refactor legacy code safely using characterization tests + Claude Code

**Templates included:**
- Test-First Prompt Templates (by language: TypeScript, Python, Go)
- Spec Writing Checklist
- The "Make This Test Pass" master prompt

**Why this matters beyond Claude Code:**
Spec-driven development makes you a more rigorous thinker. You learn to define "done" before starting. This skill transfers to architecture decisions, team communication, and technical leadership.

### Module 2: Small Batch Workflow

**The principle:** Claude Code excels at focused, well-scoped tasks. It struggles with sprawling, ambiguous work. The art is in the decomposition.

**What you'll learn:**
- Why large prompts produce worse results than small ones (context degradation)
- The 30-Minute Rule: if Claude Code can't finish in 30 minutes, the batch is too big
- Breaking features into Claude-Code-sized chunks
- The Commit Rhythm: one batch = one commit = one reviewable unit
- How to maintain momentum across multiple small batches

**Practical exercises:**
- Take a feature epic and decompose it into Claude Code batches
- Implement a multi-file change as a series of small batches
- Practice the "scope negotiation" conversation with Claude Code

**Templates included:**
- Batch Decomposition Worksheet
- The Small Batch Prompt Framework
- Commit Message Templates for AI-assisted work

**Why this matters beyond Claude Code:**
Small batch thinking is how senior engineers manage complexity. It's how you ship continuously instead of in big bangs. It's how you make code review possible. Claude Code just makes the feedback loop faster.

### Module 3: Context Management

**The principle:** Claude Code makes decisions based on the context it has. Bad context = bad decisions. Your job is to give it the context a senior engineer would need.

**What you'll learn:**
- The three types of context Claude Code needs: architectural, domain, and conventional
- Building a Project Context Document (the "briefing" for Claude Code)
- Domain language: teaching Claude Code your ubiquitous language
- Pattern libraries: showing Claude Code how you do things here
- The CLAUDE.md file: your project's constitution

**Practical exercises:**
- Create a Project Context Document for your codebase
- Define your domain's ubiquitous language in a format Claude Code can use
- Build a pattern library from your existing code

**Templates included:**
- Project Context Document Template
- Domain Glossary Template
- Pattern Library Structure
- CLAUDE.md Starter Template

**Why this matters beyond Claude Code:**
Context management is knowledge management. The document you create for Claude Code is also the onboarding doc for new team members. It's the architectural decision record. It's the shared understanding that enables team velocity.

### Bonus: The Integration

**Putting it all together:**
- The complete workflow: Context → Spec → Small Batch → Implement → Review
- Setting up your environment for Engineering Excellence + Claude Code
- Daily rhythms and habits
- When to override Claude Code (and when to trust it)
- Measuring your improvement

## Target Buyer

**Primary: The Ambitious Senior Engineer (ICP #2)**

Profile:
- 5+ years experience, wants to move toward architecture/leadership
- Already uses Claude Code, knows there's untapped potential
- Values engineering craft, not just shipping fast
- Sees AI as career accelerator, not threat
- Invests in skills (courses, books, conferences)

Psychographics:
- Believes in fundamentals over hacks
- Wants to be the engineer who "gets" AI before everyone else
- Career-motivated: this is a competitive advantage
- Will implement immediately, share with team if it works

**Why they buy:**
"I've been using Claude Code for months but I know I'm not getting the full value. This promises to unlock it through practices I already respect (TDD, small batches). And it'll make me better at my craft regardless of AI."

**Secondary: The Engineering Leader (ICP #1)**

Profile:
- CTO/VP Eng researching AI adoption strategy
- Wants to give team a systematic approach (not "just use Claude Code more")
- Looking for something rigorous, not gimmicky

**Why they buy:**
"I need to roll this out to my team. This gives me a framework to teach, not just a tool to install."

## Positioning & Messaging

### Headline

**Primary:** "Engineering Excellence for Claude Code: The 3 Practices That Separate 10x Results from Frustration"

## Competitive Differentiation

### What exists in market:
- Generic "AI productivity" courses (prompt tricks, no depth)
- Claude Code documentation (reference, not methodology)
- YouTube tutorials (scattered, no system)
- Twitter threads (entertainment, not transformation)

### What we offer:
- **Practice-based, not prompt-based** - Fundamentals that transfer
- **Systematic, not scattered** - Three practices that form a complete approach
- **Engineering-focused, not AI-focused** - Makes you better regardless of tools
- **Specific to Claude Code** - Not generic "AI coding" advice
- **Action-oriented** - Templates, exercises, immediate implementation

### Why competitors can't easily copy:
- Requires deep engineering excellence expertise (decade of practice)
- Requires understanding of both AI and engineering fundamentals
- Requires ability to teach practices, not just demonstrate tricks
- Connected to larger Software Factory vision and methodology

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Claude Code changes significantly
**Mitigation:** Practices are tool-agnostic. TDD, small batches, and context management work with any AI tool. Update specific prompts as needed.

### Risk: Market saturated with "AI courses"
**Mitigation:** Position as engineering course, not AI course. "Engineering Excellence" differentiates from prompt hack content.

### Risk: Too advanced for beginners
**Mitigation:** Clear "Who This Is NOT For" section. Prerequisites stated upfront. Don't dilute for broader audience.

### Risk: Engineers don't implement
**Mitigation:** Exercises are small and specific. "Implement this week" framing. Email sequence reinforces action.
