# Daily Rhythms and Habits

## The Morning Setup (10 min)

### 1. Context Check
- Is CLAUDE.md current?
- Any new patterns introduced yesterday?
- Any domain knowledge to capture?

### 2. Plan the Day
- What features/tasks today?
- Pre-decompose into batches
- Identify context needed

### 3. Prepare Your Environment
- Tests running in watch mode
- Relevant files open
- Context document accessible

## The Implementation Rhythm

### Each Feature
```
[5 min]  Gather context
[10 min] Write specs
[5 min]  Decompose into batches
[Loop]   Implement batches
[5 min]  Final review
[2 min]  Commit
```

### Each Batch
```
[2 min]  Write/verify test
[1 min]  Send to Claude Code
[5 min]  Review output
[2 min]  Run tests
[2 min]  Refactor if needed
[1 min]  Commit
```

### The Pomodoro Pattern
```
25 min - Implementation (2-3 batches)
5 min  - Break + review
25 min - Implementation (2-3 batches)
5 min  - Break + review
...
```

## End of Day (10 min)

### 1. Clean Up
- All tests passing?
- Any uncommitted work?
- Any WIP to note?

### 2. Capture Learning
- Any new patterns to document?
- Any domain knowledge learned?
- Update CLAUDE.md if needed

### 3. Prepare Tomorrow
- What's next?
- What context will be needed?
- Any blockers to address?

## Weekly Review (30 min)

### Metrics to Track
- Batches completed per day
- Average batch time
- Test coverage change
- Defects escaped

### Questions to Ask
- Are batches getting smaller or larger?
- Is Claude Code output quality improving?
- Are specs getting better?
- What patterns are emerging?

### Adjustments to Make
- Update CLAUDE.md with lessons
- Add examples for common patterns
- Refine decomposition strategies
- Calibrate trust based on results
