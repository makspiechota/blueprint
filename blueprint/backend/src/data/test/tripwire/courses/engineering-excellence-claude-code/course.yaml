  profile: |
    Senior engineers (5+ years experience) who want to master AI-augmented development.
    Already using Claude Code, knows there's untapped potential. Values engineering craft,
    not just shipping fast. Sees AI as career accelerator, not threat.
  why_they_buy: |
    "I've been using Claude Code for months but I know I'm not getting the full value.
    This promises to unlock it through practices I already respect (TDD, small batches).
    And it'll make me better at my craft regardless of AI."

  Claude Code is incredibly powerful. But most engineers use it like a fancy autocomplete.
  They're using a manufacturing robot as a typewriter.

  The engineers who get 10x results from Claude Code aren't better prompters. They're better
  engineers. They apply the same practices that made them effective before AI - and those
  practices make AI exponentially more effective.

  Three practices. That's all it takes:
  1. Spec-Driven Development - Write the test first, let Claude Code implement
  2. Small Batch Workflow - Break work into 30-minute chunks Claude Code can execute reliably
  3. Context Management - Give Claude Code the architectural knowledge it needs

  These aren't AI tricks. They're engineering fundamentals that happen to unlock AI's full potential.
outcomes:
  - Master the Test-First Loop with Claude Code (Red -> Claude Code -> Green -> Refactor)
  - Break any feature into Claude-Code-sized batches using the 30-Minute Rule
  - Create a Project Context Document and CLAUDE.md for your codebase
  - Implement the complete workflow from Context to Spec to Small Batch to Review
