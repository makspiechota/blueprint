description: |
  Never ask Claude Code to implement something you can't verify.
  Write the test first. The test IS the specification.
duration: 45 minutes
learning_outcomes:
  - Understand why "write a function that does X" fails and "make this test pass" succeeds
  - Master the Test-First Loop: Red -> Claude Code -> Green -> Refactor
  - Write specs Claude Code can execute against (executable specifications)
  - Know when to write the test yourself vs. asking Claude Code to write it
  - Apply the "Two Agents" pattern for adversarial validation
