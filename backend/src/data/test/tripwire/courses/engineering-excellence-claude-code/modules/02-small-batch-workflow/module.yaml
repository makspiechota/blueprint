description: |
  Claude Code excels at focused, well-scoped tasks. It struggles with sprawling,
  ambiguous work. The art is in the decomposition.
duration: 45 minutes
learning_outcomes:
  - Understand why large prompts produce worse results (context degradation)
  - Apply the 30-Minute Rule for batch sizing
  - Break features into Claude-Code-sized chunks
  - Master the Commit Rhythm (one batch = one commit = one reviewable unit)
  - Maintain momentum across multiple small batches
