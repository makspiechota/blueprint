title: "North Star for AI-Driven Autonomous SDLC"
vision: "To transform software production into a fully autonomous process powered by AI-Agents, where engineers evolve from manual laborers to strategic maintenance experts overseeing optimized production lines, mirroring the efficiency of automated factories."
problem: "Traditional software development is hindered by manual, repetitive tasks that consume engineers' time, introduce errors, and limit scalability, preventing teams from focusing on innovation and high-level optimization."
solution: "Deploy an autonomous SDLC ecosystem driven by AI-Agents that handle all manual development tasks—from coding to deployment—while providing engineers with supervisory tools to monitor, refine, and enhance the production process."
strategic_goals:
  - title: Become a go-to tool for autonomous AI-based SDLC workflows within 5 years
    description: >-
      Establish the platform as the leading solution for building autonomous,
      AI-driven software development life cycle workflows
  - title: Provider-agnostic AI integration
    description: >-
      Ensure compatibility with any AI provider (ClaudeCode, OpenCode, Codex, etc.)
      without vendor lock-in
  - title: No-code simplicity for software product building
    description: >-
      Deliver an intuitive, no-code platform that makes building software products
      as accessible as drag-and-drop tools
