    description: >-
      As the system, I need to parse workflow.yaml files and execute steps in order,
      so that designed workflows can be run autonomously.

    path: ./workflow-interpreter/user-story.yaml
  - id: step-execution
    name: Execute individual workflow steps
    description: >-
      As the system, I need to execute each step by assembling context,
      calling the provider adapter, and processing output,
      so that each agent in the workflow performs its task.

    name: Emit execution events via WebSocket
    description: >-
      As an engineer, I want to receive real-time events about workflow execution,
      so that the UI can show live progress and streaming output.
