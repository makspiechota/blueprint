    name: Separate Blueprint and Software Factory in codebase
    description: >-
      As a developer, I need Blueprint and Software Factory code to be in separate directories
      with a mode switcher in the UI, so that both products can be developed independently
      while sharing common components.

    path: ./product-separation/user-story.yaml
  - id: workflow-canvas
    name: Design workflows on visual canvas
    description: >-
      As an engineer, I want to drag-drop agent nodes onto a canvas and connect them,
      so that I can visually design the flow of my autonomous SDLC workflow.
    status: planned
    path: ./workflow-canvas/user-story.yaml
  - id: agent-node-config
    name: Configure agent nodes
    description: >-
      As an engineer, I want to configure each agent node with prompt, provider
      (claudeCode | openCode | claudeCodeWithFallback), and other settings,
      so that each step in the workflow knows what to do and which AI to use.
    status: planned
    path: ./agent-node-config/user-story.yaml
  - id: execution-view
    name: Monitor workflow execution
    description: >-
      As an engineer, I want to see real-time progress of workflow execution
      with step status, agent outputs, and errors via WebSocket,
      so that I can monitor and debug autonomous workflows.
