  Course content authoring layer for Blueprint. Enables structured creation
  and management of educational content (like "Software Factory 2027" tripwire
  course) with hierarchical navigation: Course → Modules → Lectures/Prompts/Templates.

  The DSL uses YAML for metadata (course.yaml, module.yaml) and Markdown for
  content. Visualization supports drill-down navigation with AI-assisted editing.
