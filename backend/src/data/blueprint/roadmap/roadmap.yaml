  Strategic roadmap for the Blueprint SaaS platform development.

  This roadmap defines epics, features, user stories, and AI-executable tasks

  in a hierarchical structure optimized for both human planning and AI
  execution.
epics:
  - id: new-1767354367239
    name: Create Prototype
    description: |-
      Create a very early prototype to:
      1. prove the value of such Context Management Tool
      2. Share the product with Mentors
    status: in_progress
    path: ./new-1767354367239/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767354740686
    name: Educational Content Layer
    description: >-
      Educational Content is very important in product acquisition funnel. We
      want Blueprint to support its development supported by AI (just like we do
      primarily for software development itself)
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767354740686/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767354443570
    name: Strategic Domain Driven Design Layers
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767354443570/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767354919415
    name: Backlog
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767354919415/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767710239335
    name: Terraform Visualizer
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767710239335/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767711046345
    name: Integrate with external analytics systems
    description: >-
      We want Blueprint layers (e.g. Customers Factory) to be powered with the
      actual product's analytics data (e.g. what is the actual conversion rate
      for our landing page) so the AI Agents operating on the business layer
      (e.g. Roadmap/Backlog) can create informed epic/ticket ideas to improve
      the metrics for the specified goals
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767711046345/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767707095517
    name: Possibility to create custom Blueprint Layers
    description: We need plugin architecture to allow for building custom Blueprint Layers
    status: planned
    path: ./new-1767707095517/epic.yaml
  - id: new-1767707253802
    name: Custom Layers Marketplace
    status: planned
