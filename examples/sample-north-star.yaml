# Vision: The future state and transformation you're working toward
vision: |
  Software development operates like modern manufacturing.
  Engineers design products and supervise production.
  AI agents execute the manufacturing.
  The result: systematic, scalable, high-quality software delivery.

# Problem: The high-level challenges and pain points you're addressing
problem: |
  Post-PMF B2B SaaS companies (5-15 engineers) face critical scaling challenges:

  - No systematic production process (ad-hoc, hero-driven development)
  - Can't scale engineering velocity proportionally with team growth
  - Can't leverage AI effectively (no systematic foundation)
  - Fragmented context (strategy, specifications, code are disconnected)
  - Quality inconsistencies due to lack of standardized practices
  - Knowledge locked in individual developers' heads

  These companies have product-market fit but can't execute fast enough to maintain competitive advantage.

# Solution: Your high-level approach to solving the problem
solution: |
  Build Software Factories through three integrated components:

  1. Engineering Excellence - Six systematic practices (operating procedures):
     - North Star strategy definition
     - Technical specifications with clear acceptance criteria
     - Test-driven development for quality
     - Code review with AI assistance
     - Continuous deployment automation
     - Production monitoring and incident response

  2. BLUEPRINT Platform - Context system (factory control):
     - Unified knowledge management from strategy to code
     - AI-native design for effective agent collaboration
     - Version-controlled business context alongside code
     - Automated visualization and documentation

  3. Services - Consulting and training (transformation support):
     - Assessment and customized roadmaps
     - Implementation guidance and best practices
     - Team training and capability building
     - Ongoing support for continuous improvement
