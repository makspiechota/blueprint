# Lean 1-2-3 Viability Model
#
# Demonstrates work-backwards calculations from revenue target to daily actions.
# Based on Ash Maurya's Lean 1-2-3 framework for testing business viability.
#
# To visualize this file:
#   npm run build
#   node dist/index.js visualize examples/lean-viability.yaml
#
# This generates viability-dashboard.html showing:
#   - Success criteria ($10M revenue target)
#   - Work-backwards calculations with formulas
#   - Generated targets for AAARR metrics layer
#
# Note: This is a simplified Lean 1-2-3 model. Future enhancements could include:
#   - Customer lifetime value (CLV)
#   - Churn rate assumptions
#   - Conversion funnel metrics (visitors, conversion rate)
#   - These would require schema updates and are tracked separately
#
# Business orchestration support will be added in Feature 000009.

# 3-year viability test (Ash Maurya's Lean 1-2-3 framework)
time_horizon:
  duration: 3
  unit: years

# Success criteria: What revenue target validates this is a real business?
success_criteria:
  annual_revenue:
    amount: 10000000
    currency: USD
  target_year: 3

# Work-backwards calculations from revenue goal to daily actions
calculations:
  # Step 1: Define pricing assumption
  annual_revenue_per_customer:
    amount: 1200
    currency: USD
    basis: "Assumption: $100/month subscription (12 months) - typical for developer tools SaaS"

  # Step 2: Calculate required customers to hit revenue target
  required_customers:
    count: 8334
    formula: "annual_revenue / annual_revenue_per_customer = $10M / $1,200"

  # Step 3: Calculate annual acquisition rate
  customer_acquisition_rate:
    rate: 2778
    period: year
    formula: "required_customers / time_horizon = 8,334 / 3 years"

  # Step 4: Calculate monthly acquisition target (actionable metric)
  monthly_acquisition_target:
    rate: 231
    period: month
    formula: "customer_acquisition_rate / 12 = 2,778 / 12"

# Generated targets (consumed by AAARR metrics layer)
# These targets flow down to define what metrics to track
targets:
  # Acquisition stage: How many signups do we need?
  acquisition:
    monthly_signups:
      rate: 231
      period: month

  # Revenue stage: What's our target revenue per user?
  revenue:
    arpu:
      amount: 100
      currency: USD
      period: month
