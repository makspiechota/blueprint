problem:
  top_3_problems:
    - Lack of trust in the produced code, leading to manual reviews and delays
    - >-
      Human comprehension being the bottleneck in embracing the full pace of
      AI-based workflows, slowing down innovation
    - >-
      Lack of tools for efficient monitoring of AI artifacts, making it hard to
      track and improve performance
    - >-
      Lack of tools for fast configuration of AI-agent based workflows,
      hindering quick setup and scaling
  existing_alternatives: Tools like ClaudeCode serving only as a programmer assistant
customer_segments:
  target_customers: >-
    B2B SaaS companies with engineering teams using AI agents for development
    workflows
  early_adopters: Post-PMF scaleups
unique_value_proposition:
  single_clear_message: >-
    Engineering excellence legacy enables reliable AI autonomous workflows,
    unlike ClaudeCode's code-editing without SDLC foundation
  high_level_concept: >-
    No-code platform but for building AI-based SDLC workflows, not the software
    product itself
solution:
  top_3_features:
    - >-
      Engineering Excellence foundations (Extreme Programming, Trunk Based
      Development, Feature Flags, Monitoring and Alerting) being in the kernel
      of the autonomous AI-agents workflows
    - No-code tooling for configuring agents (prompts, models) and workflows
    - Comprehensive monitoring tools for AI artifacts
    - >-
      AI-first Context Management System (Blueprint) for structured,
      machine-readable business context (The system we use here)
channels:
  path_to_customers:
    - >-
      Trainings and online courses about how engineering excellence enables
      autonomous AI SDLC-workflows (during the course - minimal implementation
      built, showing the potential)
    - Conferences, podcasts, webinars (see example [[software-factory-boiling-frogs-call-for-papers]])
    - Partnerships with AI providers and tech platforms
revenue_streams:
  revenue_model: SaaS subscription model for platform access

unfair_advantage:
  cant_be_copied: >-
    Decade of deep expertise in SDLC development, encompassing methodologies
    from business strategy to design patterns
