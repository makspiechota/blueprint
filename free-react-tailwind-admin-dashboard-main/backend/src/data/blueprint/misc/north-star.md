# Business North Star: The Software Factory

See [[strategy]] for detailed business strategy.

## The Vision: Software Factory

**Future State (3-5 years):**
Software development operates like modern manufacturing. Engineers design products and supervise production. AI agents execute the manufacturing. The result: systematic, scalable, high-quality software delivery.

**In a Software Factory:**
- **Engineers = Factory Engineers**: Design strategy, architecture, and production workflows. Supervise quality and optimize the factory line.
- **AI Agents = Manufacturing Robots**: Execute implementation, testing, deployment. Follow systematic procedures and quality standards.
- **BLUEPRINT = Factory Control System**: Provides specifications, business context, and instructions to AI agent workers. Single source of truth.
- **6 Practices = Factory Operating Procedures**: Ensure quality, safety, and systematic operation at scale.

**The Transformation:**
From ad-hoc, manual coding → To systematic, AI-augmented software manufacturing

## The Problem We Solve

### Current Reality: Broken "Factories"

Post-PMF B2B SaaS companies (5-15 engineers, $1-5M ARR) face these challenges:

**1. Ad-hoc "Manufacturing"**
- No systematic production process
- Hero-driven, manual work
- Can't scale (hiring more people doesn't increase velocity proportionally)
- Can't leverage AI effectively (no systematic foundation)

**2. Fragmented Context**
- Strategy in slides, specs in Jira, docs in Notion, code in GitHub
- AI agents lack business context (don't understand what to build or why)
- Engineers disconnected from business outcomes
- Manual overhead: repeating context to every tool/person/agent

**3. No Factory Infrastructure**
- Can't automate safely (afraid of breaking things)
- Can't deploy frequently (manual, risky)
- Can't trust AI output (no validation systems)
- Can't scale engineering systematically

**Result:** Companies want AI-augmented development but lack the systematic foundation to make it work. Adding AI to ad-hoc processes creates chaos, not velocity.

## Our Solution: Build Your Software Factory

We help companies build Software Factories through three components:

### 1. Engineering Excellence (Factory Operating Procedures)
**Systematic practices that enable reliable, scalable software manufacturing**

**The 6 Practices Framework:**

**Execution Excellence (Foundation):**
- **Small-batch development**: Manufacture in small, reviewable increments
- **Test-driven development**: Validate quality systematically (tests as specifications for AI agents)
- **Feature flags**: Deploy safely, decouple deployment from release (safe experimentation)

**Strategic Excellence (Scale):**
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear specifications and shared language (context for AI agents)
- **Product Engineering culture**: Engineers understand business outcomes (design the right products)
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated quality checks and deployment (factory automation)

**Philosophy:**
- Engineering excellence is the operating system for Software Factories
- AI agents are powerful, but need systematic procedures to work reliably
- These practices were needed before AI; AI just makes them essential
- Without practices, AI creates chaos. With practices, AI enables factory-scale production.

### 2. BLUEPRINT Platform (Factory Control System)
**The infrastructure that makes Software Factories possible**

**What BLUEPRINT Provides:**
- **Structured Business Context**: Strategy → Domain Model → Executable Specs
- **AI Agent Instructions**: Context and specifications for autonomous agents
- **Single Source of Truth**: Business knowledge accessible to humans and AI
- **Spec Generation**: OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, event schemas automatically generated
- **DDD Tooling**: Subdomains, bounded contexts, event storming, ubiquitous language

**Role in Software Factory:**
- Provides "blueprints" (specifications) to AI manufacturing agents
- Connects business strategy to code execution
- Enables Product Engineering (engineers design, agents manufacture)
- Makes autonomous SDLC possible

**Current Status:** Building now, dog-fooding on own business, alpha in 3-6 months

### 3. Software Factory Services (Consulting + Training)
**Help companies build and operate their Software Factories**

**Corporate Training:**
- 2-day workshops teaching Software Factory prototypes
- Learn to supervise AI agents as manufacturing workers
- Hands-on: Build autonomous SDLC workflows

**Consulting:**
- 3-6 month Software Factory transformation engagements
- Implement 6 practices across the team
- Deploy BLUEPRINT as factory control system
- Train engineers to design and supervise (not just code)

**Education:**
- Online courses teaching factory foundations
- Templates, tools, and frameworks
- Community and ongoing support

## The Dual ICP Flywheel

**How the two ICPs work together:**

```
Corporate Training → 20 Aspirational Engineers Learn Software Factory
    ↓
Engineers Get Excited → Implement practices on their teams
    ↓
Internal Champions → "We should do this company-wide!" → Evangelize to CTO
    ↓
Engineering Leader → Books consultation call
    ↓
Consulting Engagement → $5K-15K transformation (ICP #1)
    ↓
Case Study + Success → More engineers want training (ICP #2)
    ↓
External Ambassadors → Blog posts, talks, LinkedIn → More awareness
    ↓
REPEAT: More training participants + More consulting leads
```

**Key Insight:** ICP #2 (engineers) generates both direct revenue (training) AND consulting leads (ICP #1). This creates a bottom-up sales strategy where practitioners pull leadership into transformations.

---

## Market Segmentation by Phase

### Phase 0-1: Focus on ICP #1 + ICP #2 (parallel)
- **ICP #1:** 2-4 consulting clients (validate methodology, generate case studies)
- **ICP #2:** 2-4 training deliveries with 40-80 engineers (cashflow + ambassadors)
- Prove the flywheel works (training → champions → consulting)

### Phase 2: Scale Both ICPs
- **ICP #1:** 10+ consulting clients (proven methodology, clear ROI)
- **ICP #2:** Monthly training deliveries (200+ engineers trained/year)
- Ambassador network active (blog posts, talks, LinkedIn shares)
- Training → consulting conversion rate proven (5-10%)

### Phase 3: Add ICP #3 (Enterprise)
- **ICP #3:** Larger engineering orgs ($10M+ ARR, 50-200 engineers)
- BLUEPRINT platform ready for enterprise scale
- Need ICP #1 case studies to sell to ICP #3
- Enterprise deals: $50K-200K transformations

## Unique Positioning: Building the Software Factory

### We're NOT:
- ❌ Just AI tools/tips (no systematic practices, no business context)
- ❌ Just consulting (not scalable without platform)
- ❌ Just project management (no AI integration, no practices)
- ❌ Just DDD tooling (no business layer, no full stack)
- ❌ Just velocity tips (no strategic alignment, no autonomy vision)

### We ARE:
- ✅ **Execution + Strategy**: 6 practices (tactical + strategic) = factory operating system
- ✅ **Practices + Platform**: Consulting implements, BLUEPRINT scales = complete factory infrastructure
- ✅ **Engineering + Business**: Product Engineering bridges the gap = engineers as factory designers
- ✅ **Human-readable + AI-readable**: Dual interface = factory control system
- ✅ **Vision + Reality**: Building toward autonomous SDLC, delivering value today = honest bridge to future
- ✅ **Education + Software + Services**: Complete ecosystem for Software Factory transformation
